## •	What is thrifting?

Thrifting is a sustainable fashion. The clothes that are used/less-used/unused/sometimes brand new, are sold for a way lower prices across various platforms both online and offline. Thrifting can simply be referred as, selling and buying of clothes that are curated by consumers for a way cheaper price. 

## •	How thrifting is a sustainable fashion?

Sustainable fashion is an environmental friendly fashion revolution which causes less harm to environment. The reason that I referred thrifting as sustainable fashion is that, thrifting can make less wastage of clothes are they are not used by people. Stocks that are not sold by companies are thrown away from warehouses. Instead of throwing them away, thrifting them can make a good profit for either person and also for the environment.

## •	How is vintage stuff being different from thrifting?

There is a thin line between thrifting and buying vintage clothing. We can call buying vintage stuff as thrifting if they are loved by someone previously. Vintage clothing can include 90s or before clothing and some of the people sell it as a privilege because vintage clothes are a rare find. A regular thrifting can be from the new era that were loved previously or just some months back stock that was smuggled (I don’t know if I can call that) from factory outlet for a way lesser price and sold in thrift stores. Sometimes you can find peak luxurious products in thrift stores that are for way lesser prices. That is the very beauty of thrifting.

## •	What do you get in thrift stores?

A product in a thrift store can be any item that can be used by a person. We can find various fashion stuff like cargos, jeans, tees, shirts, jerseys, joggers, perfumes, caps, shoes, boots, etc. You can find you favorite hyped product like an Air Jordan 1 for an affordable price with greater quality that you can use for a while as per the value and quality of the product. As vintage clothing and upcycling is getting trendy day by day many people are curating stuff from brands like Wrangler, Levi’s, Duluth, Carhartt, Dickies, and many of the vintage brands. We will discuss about upcycling later in the upcoming blogs.

## •	Why do I like vintage brands and thrifting.

It is all about the curiosity about the efforts they put in the work. The brands that are very “vintageous” like a Levi’s or wrangler are established in the early 19th century. Since then, they used to manufacture various type of workwear for ease of work. A carpenter pants that are started as a trend in workwear culture, does have various pockets for carrying tools. A pocket that is after the front pocket is designed to hold tools. A double knee pants has an extra stitch around the knee part for putting on a knee pad for various people that work in industries. Though the industrial revolution is taking place in the countries, people never stopped making comfortable wear for the ease of work. FYI, we are in Industrial Revolution 4.0. Brands like dickies, Carhartt, etc., still manufacture workwear as per the vintage designs.

## •	Thrifting in India

If you ask me if those brands are available in India, my answer is no. India adopts western culture very slowly and it is not bad that tastes of people vary. It is subjective. Even though people like western fashion culture, the count is very less and it costs way more for the brands to manufacture and deliver to that numbers. Which is why, brands doesn’t curate much in india. Even though brands like Wrangler are well established in India, the styles in the clothing vary much compared with the home country of the brand. They just adopt styles to the tastes of the regional people for more sales. In recent times, the stuff that is imported for thrifting by various stores, from western countries, are sold in India. Many brands like Carhartt are still not available in india yet people get them delivered somehow from other sources. Sites like eBay also sell thrifted clothes. A brand new thrifted piece costs less than half of the store price (sometimes the price drop might be insane). 

Amazon india sells some workwear clothes like dickies double knee pants but costs touch sky as they deliver it globally. But a curious person can make it possible anyhow : ).  Many of the thrift stores doesn’t accept returns. We can understand that they are handpicked pieces and the sizes that are mentioned by them are legit. It is already a thrifted piece so stores doesn’t encourage returns or refunds. THAT IS OKAY. For me, I personally like baggy cargos, carpenter pants and double knee pants. A brand maniac that wears only branded clothes as he has trust issues with lower cost brands might easily like thrifting.
