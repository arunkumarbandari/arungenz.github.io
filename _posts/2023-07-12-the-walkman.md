    &emsp;Here we are with another topic this week. I myself enjoy vintage tech very much. It has the authenticity and aesthetics that I don’t feel in new-gen tech. However, an upgrade is always vital for survival. Yet we have to keep recalling the past. In this article, we will discuss Portable Cassette Players.
</div>

### GENESIS

<div style="text-align: justify;">
    &emsp;Vinyl Records were invented over a century before cassettes were made. Vinyl Record Players are the most attractive music machines that have come back into popularity in recent times. However, Vinyl Discs get distorted and noisy over time. In 1963, when cassettes were made, music became inexpensive. Anyone can get a tape at much lower prices and enjoy music at home. As soon as they were launched, they reached the roots of the planet due to their price and excellence.

<div style="text-align: justify;">
    &emsp;Before the invention of the Walkman, there were boomboxes that people carried around to listen to music. But they were excessively large and too heavy to carry around the streets. Eventually, smaller became better.

### TECHNICAL INFO

<div style="text-align: justify;">
    &emsp;Cassettes are produced very affordably as they use plastic for the body, and the tape inside is made of a narrow plastic ribbon coated with fine particles of iron oxide or other readily magnetizable material. It features a precise mechanism that permits tape to flow from one end to the other. It’s quite easy to record or erase a cassette tape. A deck player is enough for a person to record music and spread it among their fellow classmates. It is all magnetic information that has been supplied to the tape, and it will endure for reasonable years. If you know about mixtapes, you are pretty millennial.

### PORTABLE CASSETTE PLAYERS

<div style="text-align: justify;">
    &emsp;We can say the word "Walkman" describes it better than being called a Portable Cassette Player. It was the concept of Sony co-founder Masara Ibuka. He is a very big audiophile. He used to carry a big cassette player to listen to music, which journalists used to utilize for interviewing. He believed it was impractical as a portable music machine and tried working on it.
</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
    &emsp;Sony started working on its initial Walkman project. They removed all the additional material from a cassette player that wasn’t essential for playing music. They left with just enough components to let you play magnetic tapes. That was the foundation for the first Walkman.

<div style="text-align: justify;">
    &emsp;After the invention of the Walkman, various firms brought their own versions of the Walkman. It has become a part of their existence, just as a smartphone is today. A Walkman has revolutionized the way people stroll in the streets or travel to locations with music along with them. All it needs are batteries and headphones. The cassettes are fairly economical, as we discussed previously. Music has spread throughout the world. Other than Sony, many companies also had the best cassette players. <b>Aiwa</b>, <b>Philips</b>, <b>Panasonic</b>, etc., made the best portable cassette players in the era.

<div style="text-align: justify;">
    &emsp;The Walkman's drop started when Compact Discs were introduced. They are more reliable and offer the best quality of production at that time. Even right now, CDs are being used in a wide range of countries. Sony shut down its production of the Walkman completely in 2010. Today, a Walkman with good play condition sells for at least $100 at numerous platforms like <b>eBay</b>, <b>Retrospekt</b>, etc.

<div style="text-align: justify;">
    &emsp;Even though this is not the era of analog music, the Walkman is still seen in pop culture. Pop artists like Charlie Puth, Adele, Billie Eilish, etc. still produce their music in analog forms like Vinyl Records, Cassette tapes, and CDs.

<div style="text-align: justify;">
    &emsp;Enthusiasts like me still yearn for retro collections such as the Walkman, Nintendo, vintage clothing, etc. They bring greater value with time as they are a part of our past. I guess I gave you enough information concerning the Walkman. Please offer your feedback and let us discuss it more in the comments as well. Peace.
